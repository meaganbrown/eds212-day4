## Leslie Matrix Example
Model population changes using the same example we did in lecture. 
```{r}

insect_leslie <- matrix(c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0,08, 0), 
                        nrow =3, 
                        ncol = 3, 
                        byrow = TRUE)

insect_leslie
  

```

```{r}
# Initial Condition

insect_y0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)

insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y0

insect_y1
```

Estimate populations at each lifestage at year 2 and year 3

```{r}
# Year 2

insect_y2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y1 
insect_y2

```

```{r}

```
